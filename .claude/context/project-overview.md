4. **Review Process**: GitHub PR workflow for code quality

## Usage Patterns

### New Project Initialization
```bash
/pm:init                    # Setup system dependencies
/context:create             # Initialize project context
/pm:prd-new project-name    # Create first PRD
/pm:prd-parse project-name  # Generate implementation plan
/pm:epic-oneshot project-name # Create GitHub issues
```

### Daily Development Workflow
```bash
/context:prime              # Load project context
/pm:status                  # Check overall project health
/pm:next                    # Get next priority task
/pm:issue-start 1234        # Start work on specific issue
/pm:sync                    # Sync with GitHub when done
```

### Team Coordination
```bash
/pm:standup                 # Generate team status report
/pm:blocked                 # Identify blocking dependencies
/pm:in-progress            # See all active work
/pm:search "feature-name"   # Find related work across project
```
