# Project Brief

## What This Project Does

**Claude Code PM** is a production-ready project management system that transforms how development teams ship software using AI assistance. It implements a complete workflow from product requirements to deployed code with full traceability and parallel execution capabilities.

**Core Value Proposition**: Stop losing context, stop blocking on tasks, stop shipping bugs. This battle-tested system turns PRDs into epics, epics into GitHub issues, and issues into production code.

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Every development team struggles with the same fundamental issues:
- **Context evaporates** between Claude Code sessions, forcing constant re-discovery
- **Parallel work creates conflicts** when multiple developers touch the same code
- **Requirements drift** as verbal decisions override written specifications
- **Progress becomes invisible** until the very end, creating delivery surprises

### The Solution
A systematic approach that:
- **Preserves context** through structured project knowledge management
- **Enables parallel execution** via Git worktrees and agent coordination
- **Enforces spec-driven development** with PRD-to-code traceability
- **Provides real-time visibility** through GitHub Issues integration

## Project Scope

### In Scope
**Workflow Automation**:
- PRD creation and decomposition into executable tasks
- GitHub Issues as project database and coordination layer
- Parallel agent execution without conflicts
- Context preservation and session continuity
- Full requirements-to-code traceability

**Developer Experience**:
- Single-command project initialization
- Intuitive command system for common workflows
- Automatic dependency management and validation
- Comprehensive documentation and guidance

**Team Collaboration**:
- GitHub-native integration for team visibility
- Parent-child issue relationships for epic management
- Real-time progress tracking and status reporting
- Conflict-free parallel development

### Out of Scope
**Infrastructure**:
- Deployment and hosting (relies on existing GitHub/Git infrastructure)
- CI/CD pipeline management (integrates with existing systems)
- Database management (uses GitHub Issues as database)

**Language-Specific Features**:
- Language-specific build tools or package managers
- Framework-specific code generation
- Platform-specific deployment scripts

## Key Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Eliminate Context Loss**: Developers can return to any project after weeks and immediately understand current state
2. **Enable True Parallel Development**: Multiple team members work simultaneously without blocking or conflicts
3. **Enforce Specification Compliance**: Every code change traceable to business requirement
4. **Maximize AI Development Velocity**: Claude Code instances operate at peak efficiency with optimal context

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Reduce Bug Rates**: Spec-driven development catches issues before implementation
2. **Improve Team Coordination**: Real-time visibility into who's working on what
3. **Standardize Development Practices**: Consistent workflow across all projects
4. **Enable Remote Collaboration**: Full project state available to distributed teams

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Context Recovery**: < 5 minutes to fully understand project state after absence
- **Parallel Efficiency**: 0% blocking between team members on code conflicts
- **Bug Reduction**: 50% fewer specification-related bugs in production
- **Velocity Increase**: 30% faster feature delivery with maintained quality

### Qualitative Metrics
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Developers prefer this workflow to ad-hoc development
- **Code Quality**: Consistent architectural patterns across all features
- **Team Alignment**: All team members understand current priorities and status
- **Stakeholder Confidence**: Business stakeholders have real-time project visibility

## Target Outcomes

### For Development Teams
- **Scalable AI-Assisted Development**: Teams of any size can leverage Claude Code effectively
- **Predictable Delivery**: Accurate estimates and reliable delivery timelines
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in practices prevent technical debt accumulation

### For Individual Developers
- **Cognitive Load Reduction**: System handles project context management
- **Focus Enhancement**: Developers spend time coding, not context reconstruction
- **Skill Development**: Exposure to systematic development practices

### For Business Stakeholders
- **Transparency**: Real-time visibility into development progress
- **Traceability**: Clear connection between business requirements and delivered features
- **Risk Mitigation**: Early identification of scope creep and technical risks

## Implementation Philosophy

**Simplicity Over Complexity**: Use existing tools (GitHub, Git, Claude Code) rather than building new infrastructure

**Trust-Based Validation**: Fail fast on critical items, trust systems for routine operations

**Battle-Tested Patterns**: Implement proven practices from successful software teams

**Gradual Adoption**: System provides value immediately and scales with team maturity
